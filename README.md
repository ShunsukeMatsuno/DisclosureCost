# Replication of Cheynel and Liu-Watts (2020, RAST)
- In this R project, I replicate the analysis of [Cheynel and Liu-Watts (2020, RAST)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11142-019-09511-1). 
- In particular, I repcilate Sction 2.5 of the original paper, where they simulate the proposed estimator.
- In addition, I check the behavior of the proposed estimator with several underlying distributions of firm values.

# Files
- `rmd/Replication.Rmd` is the main script. The script is exported as `html` file, which is named `rmd/Replication.html`.
